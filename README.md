# Security Chat System

**Welcome to the Security Chat System repository!**

This project is designed to provide a secure chat system using various encryption algorithms. The system includes functionality for both clients and servers, utilizing AES, DES, and RSA encryption methods for secure communication.

## Project Components

- **AES2.py:**
  - Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm

- **CentralRepo.py:**
  - Central repository for storing and managing public keys

- **CentralRepoServer.py:**
  - Server for the central repository

- **Client.py:**
  - Client-side application for secure communication

- **DES.py:**
  - Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm

- **GUIClient.py:**
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the client application

- **GUIServer.py:**
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the server application

- **Gui.py:**
  - User interface for the chat system

- **PrivateKeysServer.py:**
  - Server handling private keys for clients

- **RSA.py:**
  - Implementation of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption algorithm

- **Server.py:**
  - Server-side application for secure communication

- **ServerRSA.py:**
  - Server handling RSA keys for clients

- **keys.db:**
  - Database storing keys for secure communication

- **private_keysServer.txt:**
  - Text file storing private keys on the server

- **public_keysServer.txt:**
  - Text file storing public keys on the server

- **ttp.py:**
  - Trusted Third Party (TTP) for key exchange

## Getting Started



## Running the Server-Side Components:

1. Execute `CentralRepoServer.py` for the central repository server.
2. Execute `PrivateKeysServer.py` for the private keys server.
3. Execute `Server.py` for the main chat server.

## Running the Client-Side Components:

1. Execute `GUIClient.py` for the graphical client interface.
2. Execute `Client.py` for the command-line client.

## Usage

Explore the different components to understand the encryption methods employed for secure communication. Customize the settings and adapt the system to your specific use case.
